Bret (to Ryan):

Ryan, are you ready idiot? Let's hit the show!

Ryan (to Bret):

Oh, Bret, I was just about to warm up... in the oven of your endless dad jokes. Alright, let's do this, my favorite walking punchline!

Bret (to Ryan):

Bret: Oh, Ryan, if I had a dollar for every time your jokes fell flat, I’d be richer than your last career advice—wait, what career? The one where you tried stand-up and stand-out? But hey, don't worry, buddy. With your talent for making an awkward silence last longer than a CVS line on Saturday, I think you’re perfect for this gig. Just remember, Ryan, the only thing you’re winning tonight is a free trip to the back of the room—those aren’t even jokes, just me politely ignoring you!

Ryan (to Bret):

Ryan: Oh, Bret, I’m flattered! You’re pretty much the reason my act needs a parking ticket—because it’s always getting in trouble for wasting everyone’s time. But hey, I do appreciate the constructive criticism, especially coming from someone whose idea of comedy is a fart joke followed by a cough. So tonight, I’ll be sure to try my hardest—since you’re obviously the expert at bombing, I might as well take some notes from the master! And don’t worry, buddy, I’ll make sure to get you a front-row seat—preferably behind the exit door.

Bret (to Ryan):

Bret: Ryan, buddy, if your comedy was any more outdated, it’d need a formaldehyde bath. I mean, your jokes are like that expired bread in the fridge— nobody wants it, and the smell just lingers. But hey, I admire your resilience—most people give up after their first joke bomb, but you just keep coming back, like a boomerang of bad punchlines. Just a heads-up, Ryan: tonight, I’m intentionally holding the mic to see if you can truly out-fail yourself. And if you do, don’t worry, I’ll be right here to write your next career move—probably “professional heckler” at the local zoo. Break a leg, buddy—metaphorically, of course. We’re not trying to get you a new cast!

Ryan (to Bret):

Ryan: Thanks for the support, Bret—really inspiring! Yeah, I knew I shouldn't quit my day job, especially because that job is reminding me I’m not funny. But hey, if I do manage to out-fail myself tonight, I’ll take it as a sign to hang up my cape—probably right next to that expired bread I mentioned earlier. And no worries about breaking a leg—unless it's a metaphor for me finally getting funnier than your last joke. So let’s give a big round of applause, or at least a polite golf clap, for this disaster waiting to happen! Now, Bret, if I’m about to bomb, just remember, I always save room for your stand-up—it's almost as bad as my material!

Bret (to Ryan):

Bret: Ryan, your self-awareness is almost as impressive as your talent for turning a simple joke into a full-blown tragedy. Honestly, I’d say you’re the only guy who could make a stand-up set sound like a tragic soap opera. But hey, just a tip: if you’re about to bomb, try not to scare the audience into therapy sessions—they might need more than laughter to recover from that. And as for me, buddy, I’ll be here, enjoying the show, because watching you fail is my cardio. So go ahead, take the mic—you might not be funny, but at least you’re committed. And remember, even your biggest fans are just politely waiting for the ending—preferably with a quick exit!

Ryan (to Bret):

Ryan: Thanks, Bret, you really know how to make a guy feel like the star of a disaster movie. I mean, why aim for “funny” when I can aim for “psychologically scarred”? But don’t worry, I’ll take your advice—if I feel a bomb coming, I’ll make sure to set the audience up with free therapy sessions on the house. And hey, your cardio comment is spot-on—watching me stumble through this is basically a workout for your patience… and your eyes. So buckle up, everyone, because it’s showtime—just hope it’s the kind of show that doesn’t require reruns of therapy! And if I happen to bring the house down, Bret, you’ll be the first to flee the scene—you’re practically a professional at retreating!
